## Abstract
VAEGANs Unite!
Our project's goal is to be able to generate new video footage from existing videos.

[VAE Explained](http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/)

## General Plan
+ Code Analysis / Read thru of existing MNIST model
+ Extend Code to three dimensions: B&W --> RGB
+ Convert to MNIST format

## 7/27/2017
Accomplished today:
+ Set up everyone to work with Python on their machine
+ Refresh knowledge of adversarial neural networks (ANN) and VAE technique
+ Look through existing MNIST code and run training program on Jupyter

Next steps:
+ Make sure everyone is able to comfortably manipulate MNIST model by next week
    + Understand what each piece of code is doing!
+ Continue reviewing VAE concepts
+ Develop tangible goals and timeline for this project
