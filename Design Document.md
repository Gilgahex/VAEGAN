## Abstract
VAEGANs Unite!
Our project's goal is to be able to generate new video footage from existing videos.

[VAE Explained](http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/)

## General Plan
+ Code Analysis / Read thru of existing MNIST model
+ Extend Code to three dimensions: B&W --> RGB
+ Convert to MNIST format

Update:
+ Convert B&W image into MNIST format
+ 

## 7/27/2017
Accomplished today:
+ Set up everyone to work with Python on their machine
+ Refresh knowledge of adversarial neural networks (ANN) and VAE technique
+ Look through existing MNIST code and run training program on Jupyter

Next steps:
+ Make sure everyone is able to comfortably manipulate MNIST model by next week
    + Understand what each piece of code is doing!
+ Continue reviewing VAE concepts
+ Develop tangible goals and timeline for this project

## 8/3/2017
Accomplished today:
+ Ran VAE number replication project from Conor's github
+ Researched MNIST and determined future steps for recreating other images

Next steps:
+ Continue researching concepts (VAE, GAN, MNIST, etc.)
+ Figure out how to convert images to MNIST format
+ Run model with new image

## 8/8/2017
Accomplished today:
+ Brainstormed ideas for adapting MNIST model to RGB (1 channel to 3 channels)
    + Discussed compression techniques (ex. Lossy, Hilbert curves, etc.)
    + Increasing the number of adversarial networks?
+ Discussing image continuity
+ Refining our project idea
    + Is the original project code transferable?
    + Generate new footage from old footage without accounting for temporal continuation
+ Chose a starting video/gif for our training set

Next steps:
+ Continue researching concepts (VAE, GAN, MNIST, etc.)
+ Figure out how to convert images to MNIST format
+ Find similar video processing projects as examples
+ Write up a simple model skeleton in Python
