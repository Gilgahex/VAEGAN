# VAE-GAN Image Classifier
### Contributors: Conor O'Brien, Jay Singh, Shakuntala Mitra, Shon Inouye

## Abstract
Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) and a Virtual Auto-encoder, our project aims to be able to classify images from popular TV show *Rick and Morty* and identify elements of the scenes (characters, objects, etc). In the future, we hope to extend this project to be able to manipulate the identified elements and potentially reconstruct images from the TV show. Our project utilizes Tensorflow, a Python machine learning library built by Google.
